    ("Eddie Rodriguez", "erod1", "dum3@ss", "German, Math, Science", "I believe that a large part of being a successful tutor is developing a friendly relationship with each of my students. I want my tutoring students to be comfortable with me so they can discuss their problem areas, secure in the knowledge that I would not judge them as a failure for needing help. Although hard work is important, it is more important for a student to motivate him or herself to continue the education process. When I work with my tutoring students, I help them break down their coursework into its constituent parts, so they can see how each piece fits together. This is especially important when developing reading comprehension or study skills for standardized tests. Deconstructing the subject matter helps students see that large, complex ideas have smaller pieces that make up the whole, and they can work toward understanding each piece. I am very passionate about the importance of clear written and spoken communication, which is why I tutor reading, writing, advanced placement tests, and college entrance tests. I am a graduate of Rice University, and in the next few years, I hope to go to law school and learn about criminal justice and foreign policy. ", 4);
